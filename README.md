# LogicGenerator
Use cvc5 to calculate a generic LUT-structure that matches a logic-function that you predefined.
A detailed explanation of how this code is structured and works can be found in the Studienarbeit of Tobias Linker "Anwendung von SAT-Techniken zur Optimierung
von Logikfunktionen fur die Implementierung auf FPGAs" from 2024.

## Set up environment
To run the code, first you need to set up cvc5. Instructions on how to set it up can be found in the "Manual for setting up cvc5" (link)

## How to use LogicGenerator
To get a better idea of how to use the LogicGenerator, you can have a look at the demo.py, the benchmarks or the examples. (link)
In the demo.py all the available parameters and functions of the LogicGenerator are presented.
The benchmarks run the Mux-4 problem and the Conway-game-of-life problem in different modes and versions.
The examples implement different logic functions, that can be calculated with the LogicGenerator.
